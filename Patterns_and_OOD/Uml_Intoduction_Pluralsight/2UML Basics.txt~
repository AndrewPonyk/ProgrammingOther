1) Two types of Modeling in UML , describe .

	Structural and Behavioral modeling .

	1) Structural : Physical things of system, static parts, (nouns)
		Diagrams:
		- Class
		- Component
		- Package
		- Deployment

	2) Behavioral modeling : Functionality(processes, interactions), Dynamic parts, (verbs)
		Diagrams:
		- Use Case
		- Sequence
		- State
		- Activity

There are 14 types of diagrams in Uml 2
( Class, Component, Composite structure, deployment, object, package,profile )
(Activity, Uml State, USe case, Communication, Interaction, Sequence, Timing)

2) Building Blocks( things, relationships ) in UML , describe.

	Things :
	- Class
	- Use Case (functions , that we expect the system to accomplish)
	- Component ( represents a modular part of a system, that encapsulates its content and whose 
	  manifestation is replaceable 	within its environment )
	- Node (used in deployment diagrams , represented by CUBE)
	- Messages (simple message , return message, asynchronous message)
	- States
	- Actions

	Relationships:
	- Association
	- Generalization (Inheritance)
	- Implementation (implementation of interface)
	- Dependency (one object is depends on other)

	

	!!!!!!!
	Different foms of Association (Association, Aggregation, Composition)
	- Association is a relationship where all object have their own life cycle and there is no owner. 
	Let’s take an example of Teacher and Student. Multiple students can associate with a single teacher and 
	a single student can associate with multiple teachers but there is no ownership between the objects
	 and both have their own lifecycle. Both can be created and deleted independently.

	- Aggregation is a specialized form of Association where all objects have their own lifecycle
	but there is an ownership: a child object can not belong to another parent object. Let’s take
	an example of Department and teacher. A single teacher can not belong to multiple departments, 
	but if we delete the department the teacher object will not be destroyed. We can think about 
	it as a “has-a” relationship.

	- Composition is again a specialized form of Aggregation and we can call this as a “death”
	relationship. It is a strong type of Aggregation. Child objects does not have their life cycle
	and if the parent object is deleted all child objects will also be deleted. Let’s take again an 
	example of relationship between House and rooms. A house can contain multiple rooms and there is no
	independent life for a room and a room can not belong to two different houses. If we delete the house its
	rooms will be automatically deleted. Let’s take another example relationship between Questions and options.
	Single questions can have multiple options and an option can not belong to multiple questions. If we delete
	a question its options will also be deleted.

3) UML Common Extensions , describe . (3 types of common extensions)

	- Annotations/Notes (or Constraints , The constraint string may be placed in a note symbol (same as used for comments) 
	 and attached to each of the symbols for the constrained elements by a dashed line.)
	- Stereotypes (A stereotype is one of three types of extensibility mechanisms in the Unified Modeling 
	 Language (UML), other two being tags and constraints. They allow designers to extend the vocabulary
	 of UML in order to create new model elements, derived from existing ones, but that have specific 
	 properties that are suitable for a particular problem)
	- Icon Stereotypes
